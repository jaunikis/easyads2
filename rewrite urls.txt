I'd suggest the following structure instead:

http://www.site.net/project/2
http://www.site.net/project/2/issuelist
http://www.site.net/project/2/issuelist/bug
This way you can make the /project/ path a reserved term (so long as you don't currently have and never plan to have
an actual top-level directory named "project" on your site). This avoids having to use multiple RewriteCond directives 
to check that the request is not for a valid file or directory every time.

If this pattern suits you, then the following rules ought to do the trick in your .htaccess file:

RewriteRule ^project/([0-9]+)$ /project.php?projectid=$1
RewriteRule ^project/([0-9]+)/([a-zA-Z0-9_-]+)$ /project.php?projectid=$1&do=$2
RewriteRule ^project/([0-9]+)/([a-zA-Z0-9_-]+)/([a-zA-Z0-9_-]+)$ /project.php?projectid=$1&do=$2&issuetypeid=$3

The above RewriteRule patterns allow for the do and issuetypeid values to contain lowercase, uppercase, digits,
underscores and hyphens, but you should modify the patterns to suit the actual constraints your site allows for these variables.
