							<h3 id="Introduction">Introduction</h3>
								<p>The benefit of the Web have come at some cost, one being the loss of privacy. 
								if you use the internet, you could be at risk of illegal activity or abuse – be it bullying,
								fraud or something more serious. Unlike seeing someone face to face, on the net,
								people aren’t always what they first seem.
								It is important to learn how to stay safe online. These skills will stay with you for life and even can save lots of money!
								</p>
								<p>We filter and don't display danger or potential scam adverts. But we can't detect 100% of them. 
								So you have to be aware and examine carefully an advert before take action on it.

									<h4>Example of fraud advert</h4>
									Easy loan offer. 
									Scammers asking for small sum of €100-€300 as first deposit to open account.  
									Looks like small sum if you promised of €10.000 €20.000 loan.

									<h4 id="Offer looks too good to be true">Offer looks too good to be true</h4>
									Am I being promised money for little or no effort on my part?
									Many offers are meant to compromise your security. Like easy loan offers, too cheap, unreal prices, etc..
									Don’t interact with adverts promoting an offer that’s too good to be true.

									Only email provided in advert!? Be careful and examine advert if it is real more suspiciously.
									Check the phone number if it is real and it is Irish number. 
									Call the seller if possible and it is Irish phone number. (some scammers comes not from Ireland and dont know Irish phone codes and put random numbers.)

									<p>
									Reputable companies (particularly large organizations)

									<h4 id="Seller asking for deposit">Seller asking for deposit</h4>
									<p>
									Even if price and phone numbers are real. You can't trust seller 100%.<br>
									Scammers mostly asking deposit in front for Pets, Cars, Money loans, job offers..<br>
									Don't pay any deposit for item online! 
									Unless you met seller in person and get receipt or signed note that he received deposit from you. 
									And even that is not keeping seller to get away with your money. 
									So avoid any deposit paying in front.

									Study links carefully before clicking; scammers use known brands to create realistic-looking links. This link is a trap; aib.payments211.ie is not the same as aib.ie

									<h4 id="What Are the Dangers of Links">What Are the Dangers of Links?</h4>
									<p>
									Trick you into visiting a fake website and entering your credentials for a well-known website<br>
									Exploit your web browser to take control of your computer or download malicious code (like ransomware)
									</p>
									<h4 id="What is URL">What is URL?</h4>
									<p>
									URLs are the complete addresses to specific websites.<br>
									www.easyads.ie/blog/Online-Safety-Tips
									</p>
									<h4 id="What is links">What is links?</h4>
									<p>
									Links point to a specific URL. Links make URLs clickable.<br>
									Links can point to URLs in clickable text.<br>
									Links can also be displayed in full: https://www.easyads.ie<br>
									Links can even be graphics or buttons: <button>Home</button>
									</p>
									<h4 id="What is domain name">What is domain name?</h4>
									<p>
									http://www.easyads.ie/blog/<br>
									The domain name in this example "easyads.ie" works like an online home address for a website.
									</p>
									<h4>Attackers Manipulate URLs to Trick Users</h4>
									<p>
									Manipulating a URL goes beyond using the right words to trick you. Attackers will often change links in other ways to look like valid URLs.
									If you see any of these warning signs in an link, look, but don’t click unless you are absolutely certain you can trust the URL.
									</p>
									<div class="row">
										<div class="col-sm-6">
											<h4 id="Shortened URLs">Shortened URLs</h4>
											<p>
											<div class="well well-sm" style="margin:5px;">http://bit1y.com/2P13uh2</div>
											Shortened URLs are forwarding addresses for longer links. Attackers use link shortening tools on the Web to conceal a link’s true destination.
											If you suspect you’ve been given a shortened URL, you can search the web for a URL expander. Copy the URL and paste it into the tool to find out where the URL really goes.
											</p>
										</div>
										<div class="col-sm-6">
											<h4 id="Number-based links">Number-based links</h4>
											<p>
											<div class="well well-sm" style="margin:5px;">http://194.135.86.241</div>
											Scammers can use number-based URLs to hide malicious sites. If you don’t know exactly where a number-based URL goes, do not click it.
											</p>
										</div>
									</div>
									<div class="row">
										<div class="col-sm-6">
											<h4 id="Look-alikes links">Look-alikes links</h4>
											<p>
											<div class="well well-sm" style="margin:5px;">
											www.bankofireland.com<br>
											www.Bank0fIreland.com
											</div>
											At first glance, these two domains look almost identical, making it easy to overlook the substitutions (0 for o). Also can be (rn for m).
											</p>
										</div>
										<div class="col-sm-6">
											<h4 id="Hyphens">Hyphens</h4>
											<p>
											<div class="well well-sm" style="margin:5px;">www.bank-of-ireland.com</div>
											Attackers often add hyphens to official brand domains, creating malicious links.
											Note: Some legitimate sites use hyphens in their domain name, but don’t click on the URL if it doesn’t look like the one you know and trust.</p>
										</div>
									</div>
									<div class="row">
										<div class="col-sm-6">
											<h4 id="Don’t Ignore the Domain">Don’t Ignore the Domain</h4>
											<p>
											<div class="well well-sm" style="margin:5px;">http://www.aib.payments211.ie/customers-validate/</div>
											Carefully examining a URL can help you determine if the domain is a scam or legitimate. If you want to know where a URL really goes, 
											look at the part of the URL after the :// but before the first /. Read this part from right to left tofirst dot. You should get (payments211.ie) that is not legit domain name. 
											</p>
										</div>
										<div class="col-sm-6">
											<h4 id="Read Between the Dots">Read Between the Dots</h4>
											<p>
											<div class="well well-sm" style="margin:5px;">http://aib.payments211.ie</div>
											You can also start with the text to the right of the first dot after the :// payments211.ie is the true domain. It’s the site you’d visit if you click on the link. "aib" here is subdomain, that is can be any word. 
											For example www.bankofireland.payments211.ie you visit same payments211.ie not legit website.
											</p>

									<h4 id="What to Do Instead of Clicking">What to Do Instead of Clicking</h4>
									<p>
									Only click on links if you’re trust them.
									Make hovering over links a habit. Rest your cursor over the link and read the URL that appears in bottom of the page, but do not click the link.
									Use your favorite search engine to verify the site. When you search for a fraudulent domain, the top result’s domain should match what you’ve entered.
