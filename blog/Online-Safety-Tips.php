								<p>The benefit of the Web have come at some cost, one being the loss of privacy. 
								if you use the internet, you could be at risk of illegal activity or abuse – be it bullying,
								fraud or something more serious. Unlike seeing someone face to face, on the net,
								people aren’t always what they first seem.
								It is important to learn how to stay safe online. These skills will stay with you for life and even can save lots of money!
								</p>
								<p>We filter and don't display danger or potential scam adverts. But we can't detect 100% of them. 
								So you have to be aware and examine carefully an advert before take action on it.

									<h4>Offer looks too good to be true.</h4>

									<h4>Seller not provided phone number.</h4>
									Only email provided in advert!? Be careful and examine advert if it is real more suspiciously.
									Check the phone number if it is real and it is Irish number.
									Call the seller if possible. (some scammers comes not from Ireland and dont know Irish phone codes.)

									<h4>Public email Address</h4>

									generally do not use public email services like Gmail and Yahoo. Be alert for this possible trap.

									<h4>Seller asking for deposit.</h4>
									<p>
									Even if price and phone numbers are real. You can't trust seller 100%.<br>
									Scammers mostly asking deposit in front for Pets, Cars, Money loans, job offers..<br>
									Don't pay any deposit for item online! 
									Unless you met seller in person and get receipt or signed note that he received deposit from you. 
									And even that is not keeping seller to get away with your money. 
									So avoid any deposit paying in front.

									<h4>Dangerous links</h4>
									Study links carefully before clicking; scammers use known brands to create realistic-looking links. This link is a trap; bank-of-ireland.site is not the same as bankofireland.ie.
